The goal of this study is the identification of STAT1-dependent gene signatures in Macrophage inflammatory Responses. To achieve this, relevant datasets including Chip-seq, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq from GEO repository are collected, analyzed and integrated. This provides an integrative gene list involved in inflammatory response.

The `pdf file` provides a comprehensive report on the analysis, tools, and corresponding output.
The `qmd file` shows the corresponding codes for the generation of this report.
